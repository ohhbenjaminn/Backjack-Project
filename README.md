## Technologies Used:
##### HTML was used to structure the page and add content and context.
##### CSS was used to style and layout page to look presentable. It was also used to alter fonts, sizes, spacing, add animations, add images, and add buttons.
##### JAVASCRIPT was used to add functionality and interactive to the page. I used it to add math properties, conditionals, and DOM minipulations.

## Getting Started:
Players compete to obtain the total sum of the card values in their hand as close as possible to 21.

- When players hand value exceeds that of 21, they bust(lose automatically).

- Players are allowed to “hit”/draw as many times as they want.

- When players are satisfied with their hand, click stay to continue for results. 

- Good luck. Have fun and don’t forget to shout “Winner winner chicken dinner” when you win!
